This program is a Go implementation of a string search.

How it works
The user is prompted to enter a string.
The program searches through the entered string for the characters 'i', 'a', and 'n'.
If the entered string starts with the character 'i', ends with the character 'n', and contains the character 'a', the program prints "Found!".
If the entered string does not meet the above conditions, the program prints "Not Found!".
The program is not case-sensitive, so it does not matter if the characters are upper-case or lower-case.
How to use
Download or clone the repository to your computer.
Open the file main.go with a Go compiler or text editor.
Run the program by typing go run main.go in your terminal.
Input a string when prompted.
The program will search for the characters 'i', 'a', and 'n' in the entered string and print either "Found!" or "Not Found!" depending on the search results.
